EU - .eu DAS client


+--------------+
| INTRODUCTION |
+--------------+

For registrars and others there is an alternative to WHOIS to see if a .eu
domain name is available, registered or already applied for. 

The service is called DAS (Domain Availability Service) and does not have
limitations as to how many queries can be done in a given time. 

However, you will only get the status of the domain name as a reply to your
query, not the full address etc of an applicant or holder.

This software is an eu DAS client.
